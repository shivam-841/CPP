Final Notes:

    Code Quality: Be prepared to write clean, well-documented, and efficient code, as industry projects prioritize maintainable codebases.
    Time Management: During the test, balance speed with accuracy. If you get stuck on a question, it might be best to move on and come back later if you have time.

By covering these topics, you'll be well-prepared for the C++ test and have a solid understanding of the tools and techniques commonly used in industrial projects.
